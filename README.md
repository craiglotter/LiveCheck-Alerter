LiveCheck-Alerter
=================

LiveCheck Alerter is used to automatically ping target machines at given intervals, monitoring whether those machines are up and running based on their ping response. This can be used to detect possible power outages or break in network connectivity. If a target machine is deemed unreachable, a notification email is generated. Similarly, once reported down, a notification email is again sent out once the machine comes back onto the network. Created by Craig Lotter, January 2008
