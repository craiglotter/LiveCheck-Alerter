LiveCheck Alerter is used to automatically ping target machines at given intervals, monitoring whether those machines are up and running based on their ping response. This can be used to detect possible power outages or break in network connectivity. If a target machine is deemed unreachable, a notification email is generated. Similarly, once reported down, a notification email is again sent out once the machine comes back onto the network.

Multiple target hosts and multiple email recipients can be specified, using ";" as a delimiting character.

The about and help menu items brings up the about and help dialog screens respectively. The AutoUpdate option checks for any updates for this application.
